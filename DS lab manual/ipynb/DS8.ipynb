    "            \"what is data analytics\": \"> Data analytics is the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information, draw conclusions, and support decision-making.\",\n",
    "            \"what are the differences between data analytics and data science\": \"> Data analytics primarily focuses on descriptive and diagnostic analysis of data, while data science involves predictive and prescriptive analysis, often using machine learning and deep learning techniques.\",\n",
    "            \"what is machine learning\": \"> Machine learning is a subset of AI that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\",\n",
    "            \"what is deep learning\": \"> Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to analyze various factors of data.\",\n",
    "            \"what is supervised learning\": \"> Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, and it learns to make predictions based on input features and corresponding target labels.\",\n",
    "            \"what is unsupervised learning\": \"> Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, and it identifies patterns, structures, or clusters within the data.\",\n",
    "            \"explain the steps in making a decision tree\": \"> The steps in making a decision tree include selecting the best attribute to split the data, calculating impurity measures, creating child nodes, and repeating the process recursively until a stopping condition is met.\",\n",
    "            \"differentiate between univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis\": \"> Univariate analysis deals with a single variable, bivariate analysis involves two variables, and multivariate analysis considers multiple variables simultaneously to understand their relationships.\",\n",
    "            \"how should you maintain a deployed model\": \"> Maintaining a deployed model involves monitoring its performance, retraining it with new data, updating dependencies, and ensuring data quality and security.\",\n",
    "            \"what is a confusion matrix\": \"> A confusion matrix is a table used in classification to evaluate the performance of a model by showing the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.\",\n",
    "            \"how is logistic regression done\": \"> Logistic regression is used for binary classification and involves modeling the probability of the binary outcome using the logistic function.\",\n",
    "            \"what is the significance of p-value\": \"> The p-value is used in hypothesis testing to determine the probability of obtaining observed results or more extreme results under the null hypothesis. A small p-value indicates evidence against the null hypothesis.\",\n",
    "            \"mention some techniques used for sampling\": \"> Sampling techniques include random sampling, stratified sampling, systematic sampling, and cluster sampling.\",\n",
